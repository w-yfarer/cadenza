As a vampire turned demon, Ichi's morals are about as straight as a slinky, and she's just about as loopy. 

<p>Ichi is a twisted mind, incapable of understanding right from wrong. Emotion to her is an indiscernible blur that she can't comprehend, so her own are unpredictable and varying. At heart, Ichi really has no emotion, more akin to an apathetic psychopath convincing herself that she's at least a semi-functional member of society. Ichi simply makes up emotions she thinks are real, seemingly unable to accept she has little to none of it.</p>

Ichi's forced concern means that when she's hurting someone, she starts to feel bad for them- that isn't going to stop her though. She can't stop herself and honestly she doesn't want to, she desires nothing more than another's pain and, in turn, starts to feel overwhelming affection for that person- again, it won't stop her from killing them. Ichi's capacity to control herself is a certain absolute zero, which could explain why she is so addicted to controlling others: to fill the void she can't fill with herself. 

<p>Now, why is Ichi like this? Well, she was in the Scar enough to lose an arm and grow a flower out of her eye, but despite that most of her corruption was internal. Her brain is quite heavily damaged to say the least, dysfunctional to the core. Some days Ichi might want attention and be very docile, and some days she'll be an insane, uncontrollable monster, locking herself up before she tries to commit a small-scale massacre. Some days she won't try to stop herself, some days she is just normal. Some days she feels like she has control, even if she has none at all. Some days she wants nothing more than to die, some days she is disgusted by the concept. Some days she might want to be near people, talk to people, some days she might want to be alone in solitude. The point I really have to push here is that Ichi does not have a personality besides "apathetic psychopath". Everything piled on top is something her mind has made up for her, and that she believes. If her brain wasn't corrupted, she might not have these false emotions that give her the illusion of stability.</p>

<div class="appsh">History</div>
<div class="appsp">

A vampire, a vampire, Ichi was a vampire. What was she before being a vampire? Well, that was up in the air because she has no memory of it. If she could remember then it might explain why, as a vampire, she was so pathetic. She struggled to accept killing so much, she wanted to make more friends than foods, and yet she couldn't find herself stopping, or even slowing down. If anything, she fed [i]too much[/i], causing any race to be rather wary around her. A dark magic she excelled in particularly was manipulating the blood she drew from her victims, meaning not only was Ichi killing for food, but she was killing to maintain her magic power as well. 

<p>More and more she would kill, her rate growing until it was four or five times a day. She was lost, her mind was lost, her body was lost. She hardly knew who she was anymore, she didn't even know what her name was. Life was a blur for a good four hundred years, she still doesn't remember anything of it.</p>

Ichi's murder sprees came to the inhabitants of Nature's Scar, but she was already more of a creature than a Vampire at that point; she didn't know where she was nor did she really care, she was a voracious animal and she had moved beyond killing for reason, as well as moving beyond only killing humans. 
<br>The strange part was that she started to kill less the more she was in the Scar, her rate decreasing. She could feel her bloodlust being lifted like a curse, she could see again, she could hear again. Ichi wasn't much of a vampire anymore, instead transforming into a Demon.</br>

<p>Ichi, feeling particularly enlightened, spent more time in the Scar than probably was safe, but after a good amount of time she left.
<br>That brings us to now.</br>

Ichi spent too much time in the Scar, that much is obvious. Her left arm hardened and transformed into some kind of black armor, now devoid of flesh but rather being made of desensitized bone. Another piece of her that has been desensitized to pain is her right eye; if you haven't noticed, there is a flower shaped eyepatch over it.
<br>The thing is, that isn't an eyepatch. She isn't sure when it happened, but at some point her eye ball seems to have sprouted out of her head like a plant, and turned into petals. -so yes, what that means is that her eye became a flower, and the petals are split open pieces of sclera. If you couldn't guess, this renders her half blind.</br>

Akari is a mix between being deceptive and being genuine, and most of the time it is impossible to tell the difference. As a self-dubbed "master thief" she is, in fact, an excellent liar, deceiver, and actor. She is as good as she is because she also feels those emotions on a daily basis. Akari is a happy, innocent soul at heart, enjoying life to the fullest when she isn't doing someone's dirty work - in fact, the difference between deception and truth, day and night, is so great that you could probably call it multiple personalities. Even though they act almost exactly the same, by night her words are empty, false, and sly, just to get what she wants. 

<p>By day however, Akari is more akin to a child. She is a very friendly, very nice, very kind young lady, careful of her manners and always looking for a friend or two. She has a low attention span and gets bored easily, meaning staying on task can be difficult for her.
<br>By night Akari's patience is limitless, her tongue is sharp, and she is prepared to say anything to get where she wants, and steal what she wants. If someone needs to die for her job to be finished, then she will gladly take their life to ensure success.</br></p>

However, sometimes Akari stays happy by night, a careful and joyful little ball of stolen goods. The thing that remains the same between both personalities is theft. Akari is always a master thief, no matter what time it is.

<p>Akari also suffers from a mild, mild case of schizophrenia, having delusions and imagining entire scenes that do not happen, simply speaking to nothing.</p> 



</div>
<div class="appsh">History</div>
<div class="appsp">

Akari Akamine. That truly was the girl's name, and even if she wished to forget it, it was stuck with her, stuck in her mind, forever. 

<p>Akari was born to a rather wealthy family with a single, younger sister, enjoying a life as a mildly spoiled girl. She got most of what she wanted, even if she didn't want that much - she was always modest like that. She only took what she needed, even if she wanted to have so much more, paranoid she might ruin the perfect stability of her life.</p>

However when she was seven she began to have delusions. She would see things and hear things that nobody else could see, even if she was right next to them. She didn't know if she was insane or if they were just too scared to tell her. She couldn't have realized that she was the monster all along, could she? She was just a child, after all.

<p>Akari's delusions started happening only at night, leading her to cover it up with lies, pretend she was okay. Nobody listened to her anyway, it didn't make much sense why she suddenly cared so much about hiding her secret, but Akari wanted to, desperately. She'd break things in fits, and then pretend it was an accident.</p>

<p>That was when she began to write. Akari enjoyed writing, she enjoyed it more than anything she had ever done in her life. It was an escape where she could pretend to be somebody else, an escape where she didn't have to think about consequences, because she controlled the story and where it went. Art also intrigued her, and she began to draw passersby, modelling them into characters for her books.</p>

<p>Akari as a girl was trained in magic as well, of course, but her own involved writing spells to activate them. Usually she would use a book and an ink pen, but she began to dabble in focusing her mana into her knives. Having summoned them from another magic spell she'd written a few years ago, Akari was surprised to find herself able to write spells out of mana with her blades, a feat she, as a young child, would call bladewriting.</p>

As she grew older she began to realize the delusions were of herself, not of somebody else. She was talking to herself, nobody else. That didn't stop them however, they just kept happening, driving Akari insane to the point where she couldn't control herself, she couldn't control anything. With a single kitchen knife she would kill both of her parents in their sleep, before locking herself in her room and crying about it for a day or so. She didn't know her sister had seen, and already ran away.
<br>The only reason Akari left was because of the smell.</br>

<p>Akari's mind would only slightly recover as she started living on the streets; boxes, empty dumpsters, wherever she possibly could to survive. What did she do? Well, considering she was only thirteen she couldn't exactly start selling her body... or more like she didn't really want to, so she instead got into theft. Petty theft, regular theft, and by the time she was 16, she could perform high security heists of prized objects around the kingdoms. She really was a threat, she felt powerful. She felt powerful and her delusions began to get worse.</p>

You could perhaps call it self defense, how she split in two and generated another personality.

<p>One day Akari tried to steal from the wrong woman. Her name? Luna Astaria. Why was she still alive? Because Akari had gotten through all of Luna's defenses, only caught on the off-chance of being walked in on mid-theft. Akari liked to think she impressed the woman enough to be hired, but if she was honest it was more of a "work for me and you don't die" situation. After heartlessly ratting her employer out and having them executed without a second thought, Akari began work under Luna as just another thief, quickly rising the ranks until she became the fox's go-to when something needed stealing. The "main thief" if you will.</p>

<p>Akari was thinking about how easily she could have died that day. Fourteen was much too young to die, she needed to be a lot stronger than she was. She practiced her bladewriting more frequently, nearly every day, even going so far as to cast a spell that bound them together, and to herself. Each knife felt the stress of both each other and of Akari, and vice versa. A risky move to simply increase mobility, but she took it anyway. She could move them around telekinetically, write spells much more faster than one pen could, all by simply moving her arms, and her fingers. Along with her decoy magic she had trained when starting out as a thief, bladewriting gave her a sense of control that she'd never had before.</p>

Akari is rarely in contact with Luna now, only around to toss whatever she steals before making off to live her life until her talents are required again. She does not particularly enjoy Luna's company anyway, maybe because she almost died to her, so it doesn't matter to her.

<p>Akari's mental state has still only worsened since the murder of her family, however she now doesn't remember doing it herself, rather having watched them be murdered in front of her and yet inexplicably escaping.</p>

Akari is also a rather well-renowned Author under the pen name Niko Nakamura. She writes mainly action-adventure novels, and even draws her own art for said books. As a thief, she seems to have gained the nickname "Mono", possibly due to her pattern of only stealing a single object from her victims. She is a rather well known name, in both aspects, respected by some, feared by some. I'll let you guess which corresponds to which.

Aoi doesn't accept what she doesn't believe as the truth, as her special reality is the way she perceives the world. Anybody telling her that the way she thinks, lives, or understands is wrong, will catch Aoi's true nature.

<p>Aoi is a psychopath.</p>

Nothing is allowed to stand between Aoi and what she wants. From death threats, to blackmail, to physical abuse, Aoi's true face is that of a relentless savage that will do anything to get her way. Lies, theft, murder, they're all just methods to rid herself of those hindrances standing in her way that dare to challenge her. Aoi doesn't care about anybody, about anything, her capacity to feel pity or empathy is quite simply nonexistent. She is apathetic, cold, and dead.

<p>Aoi has a problem with the concept of cold, and to a lesser extent, bitterness and darkness. Aoi's true nature becomes more and more terrifying if someone makes her feel cold. This could be a poor attitude that pisses her off, a sense of abandonment leaving a bitter taste in her mouth as she feels cold and alone, or an actual sense of being cold.</p>

Aoi's apathy has been tainted, as she now derives pleasure from harming those that make her cold, even if she doesn't express it. It makes her feel good to return the favor, it warms her to see life fading from their eyes, she enjoys feeling them squirm.. and so Aoi is also insane.

<p>Aoi, at her core, has three settings: pretending, feeling empty, and being mad. Aoi is very good at pretending. She has already denied information fed to her and has made her own interpretations of how the world works. She, however, doesn't know the meaning of love, because love is so fickle.. and so Aoi has become infatuated with discovering love, but instead of fooling around with men like one might have expected, she has instead tried a surprisingly ethical approach. Aoi wants true happiness.
<br>However, Aoi is not perfect. Her facade may be impeccable but her eyes are empty. They have always been empty. She doesn't know what it's like to be loved, she doesn't know what it's like to be happy, and so Aoi's eyes are always empty, never filled. They seem like an abyss, swirling in her head.</br></p>

Aoi is incomplete, she feels unfulfilled, and she will do anything, and kill anyone, to fix that.

</div>
<div class="appsh">History</div>
<div class="appsp">

From birth, Aoi seemed to be taking on more of a cat-like appearance with her stubby ears and tail lacking fluff. She looked strange, her eyes were empty; but her corruption was evident.

<p>Aoi didn't know who her parents were, nor did she know her grandparents, or her great grandparents. She might have had brothers or sisters, she didn't know, at her age she didn't understand or have the capacity to care.</p>

She was quickly labelled an outcast by society, even if she didn't understand what many of the words said to her meant. They upset her, though, because she knew they were bad, she knew they were mean, without knowing what they were. Aoi 

<p>Aoi was taken in by a foster home, a place she would come to enjoy because she was treated correctly. She felt warm, she felt loved, she felt happy. Here, she wasn't beaten and abused because of her "race", she was taken care of because she was a child, confused and alone, and she needed to be protected.</p>

Aoi does not remember this.

<p>Aoi remembers being adopted from the streets by a woman with many bandages adorning her body. Aoi remembers this woman teaching her what emotions were. Aoi was told not to remember the foster home, and so she doesn't. Aoi remembers being wronged by someone, Aoi remembers warmth, but Aoi does not remember warmth from the woman. This leads Aoi to become very confused very frequently because she isn't sure who she is, or what she remembers, or where she is. Aoi is uncertain about many things because Aoi only remembers a few things.</p>

Aoi does not remember what her name is, only that it begins with "Aoi". Aoi also does not remember what she is, but be it from insults or labels she has come to understand herself as what they call a "Demon". Aoi was a clueless kid, Aoi didn't know how the world worked yet, Aoi 

<p>Aoi was told by the woman that adopted her that love came in many forms. Aoi didn't know what love was, but the love that the woman showed Aoi was not right. Aoi felt cold, Aoi didn't like the cold. Aoi didn't like the cold. Aoi didn't like the cold. Aoi didn't like it, she didn't like how the woman made her feel. Nothing felt real, it all felt cold, cold, cold, cold. Nothing was warm, it was all cold. The looks were cold, bitter, she didn't like bitter things either, she liked sweet things. The things that the woman told her were all cold, all cold.</p>

Aoi was scared, Aoi was scared of her, scared of being cold. The woman abused her, assaulted her, never let her outside, did whatever she wanted with her, saying that it was love; that giving yourself unconditionally to somebody was love. It made Aoi mad that someone thought that, it simply enraged her. Love couldn't be forced, she didn't know anything, she didn't understand anything, and so she killed the woman, because it made Aoi feel warm, because she was the one that was cold now, not Aoi. Aoi felt warm.
<br>Aoi cut her up and left her in bags in the room she was killed, blood still staining the walls and floors. She wasn't worth the effort. Locks were enough to keep people out, but it wasn't like anybody would ever come to her house anyway.</br>

<p>But nothing could stop Aoi now; she was going to find out what love was, what happiness was, she was going to be warm and nothing else was going to stand in her way.</p>

</div>

<div class="appsh">Miscellaneous</div>
<div class="appsp">

Aoi is prone to having full mental breakdowns from simply hearing the word cold in certain circumstances. In others, she couldn't seem to care less.
